### Todo
- [ ] Write the tests to ensure that pagination is working properly
- [ ] Using [Framer motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for cool animations. I can do it with other UI libraries like material UI but since I decided to use [mantine](https://mantine.dev/) documentation is not clear enough but I will challenge myself to do it
